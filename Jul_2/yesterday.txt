Yesterday I learnt:

1. Various tools installations:
  1.1 Phoenix Framework
  1.2 Erlang Installation
  1.3 POSTGRES installation
  1.4 NodeJS Installation - Compatible version 20.x

2. Create my first app, well kind of. Successfully run command that initialized the server
and allow the user to access the web page at localhost::4000

3. Downladed compatible version of Erlang extension for cursor. Different colour contrast between syntax and variable make it
easier to read and detect any error
